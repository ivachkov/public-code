Sample binary-based protocol (BPROT) for client-server communications

I. Description

BPROT is sample binary-based protocol for client-server communication. The protocol follows the basic principles found in other popular binary-based protocols like IP for message structure and operations.


II. Packet Description

Each BPROT packet contains the following fields:
* Version (4 bits)
* Flags (4 bits)
* Type (8 bits)
* Data Size (16 bits)
* Optional Data

The following values are expected/used:
* Version - 13
* Flags
	* F1 - 0x01
	* F2 - 0x02
	* F3 - 0x04
	* F4 - 0x08
* Type
	* PING
	* PONG
	* DATA
	* ACK
	* ERROR
* Data Size - unsigned integer
* Data - character array	


III. Packet Flow

The following packet flows are valid and available:
* Client checks server
	C: PING, F1, Optional data
	S: PONG, F2, Client data (if any)
* Client sends data to serve
	C: DATA, F3, Data
	S: ACK, F3 (if successfull)

	C: DATA, F3, Data
	S: ERROR, F4 (if unsuccessfull)
